<b>Focus: </b>Guaranteed, exactly-once, low-latency processing pipelines.

<b>Core Problem Solved: </b>

Ensures mission-critical data (e.g., financial trades, IoT sensor readings) is processed with both exactly-once semantics (no duplicates, no omissions) and extremely low latency (sub-5ms). Standard streaming systems often sacrifice one for the other. This solution uses an atomic transaction wrapper to guarantee data integrity during processing.

<b>The Solution Mechanism (Python): </b>

A class demonstrating the core transaction pattern required for exactly-once processing: A commit is only issued to the message queue after the payload has been successfully persisted to the database/storage.
